# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
They seem like a good idea since they help set rules so that content can be viewed the same on different browsers. This is important when the diversity of browsers is much greater than it used to be.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
Does this refer to the web standards? If so, yes they make sense. If people didn't have a set of standards to work with, then everyone might choose something different every time they created a new web page. This would probably end up making the internet look kind of messy.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
Visually they look nice, but I still haven't figured out how to use them. When going through the practice files, and was asked to change some of the elements to semantic HTML5, they just broke the web page. I couldn't find out how to update my CSS to match, but I don't even know if that's the issue. I probably spent an hour looking online without any helpful results.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
This helps normalize the css between browsers. If a browser is applying its own css, and you would rather a page displays your own css instead, you would need to first use the reset.css to set everything back to the standards, and then apply your own .css styles.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I've been a Chrome user for a number of years, before that I used Firefox. I have to use IE sometimes for work related things, and often things look somewhat broken in IE, particularly with older versions (IE 6,7,8). Newer versions of IE (9,10) seem to do a better job at displaying the same thing as what I would see displayed in Chrome.
