# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://mvdiener.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
This is harder than it seems! Sure it's easy to write a bunch of code and make a functional website, but to make something that will give the end user a good experience is something entirely different. I've only just scrached the surface on what is and isn't good design. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
Having gone through the process of re-designing my site layout a few times, I found it easier to come up with a wireframe plan than I had in the past. After that, I actually did have a lot of fun trying to design my site. I kept saying to myself "Oh! I should do that!" or, "That might be cool" and then probably spent more time than I should've on some minor details.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
It's easy to draw some boxes on a piece of paper and say "This is how it should look". Actually creating that is much more difficult, which I found out quite quickly. I methodically tried to create each box in my wireframe, and constantly looked at my page to see if it looked right. If something broke, I'd go back each step until I found the bit of code that caused the problem, and messed with it until I could get something that worked.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
For all of my drop down menus, I would like to add links. These links will be to all other pieces of work I've done (and all future stuff too) for phase 0 challenges. I need to figure out how to make stuff appear after a transition happens, instead of the text being visible beforehand.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I made it a point to use transitions, which we haven't really covered yet but I did some research into that on my own previously. I had to do a bit of extra research because I couldn't remember all of the proper syntax, but got most of it on my own.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
