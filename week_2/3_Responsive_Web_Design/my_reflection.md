# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
So this has probably been my favorite challenge to date. I've actually had FUN!! We're finally digging into how to make a better website. Up to this point I've been frustrated with my static, box-laden website, that doesn't scale or do anything interesting. Now I have some knowledge of how to make my site better, as well as scale with different browser sizes or devices. This is good stuff, and seems increasingly important, with new technology constantly hitting the market.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
With so many different devices out there, it's important to keep your web design fluid, so what you create looks good everywhere. This has caused developers to come up with ways to make this happen. I believe more variety in devices will actually make the core of web design have less variety, in the sense that we're moving towards better web standards that can scale across all devices and platforms.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
Why not? The web is a wonderful place, and everyone should have a chance to use and enjoy it, regardless of disability. Perhaps in the future, there will be an easy way to make this happen, with just a touch of a button.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
The reasoning behind fluid web design definitely resonates with me. I want the things I design to be used in many different places, so designing something that scales is incredibly important.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Looking at the practice files, I looked a bit into the transitions (those are cool!) I did a little digging and came across this site which helped with transition code format and results: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions
