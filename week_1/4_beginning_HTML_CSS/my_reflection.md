## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. The HTML itself seem pretty straight forward, each piece has made sense so far. You need a head, body, paragraphs, etc. It's almost like writing a paper for english class. However, I'm still working on understaing the relationship between HTML and CSS. I understand that the CSS will esentially stylize the HTML I've written, but I don't quite know how each part of the CSS interacts with the HTML. Looking forward to learning more about this as the week goes on.
2. It seems good that you can tell what most of the HTML is doing just by looking at the tags. Even if you haven't seen the HTML before, you can make an accurate guess as to what it might do. However, it seems fairly... boring? Maybe that's not the right word. Perhaps static is better. It doesn't look like the HTML will do much beyond existing as some formatted text on a page. You end up with a website rather than a web application. Perhaps that's where the CSS comes into play, to make things more awesome. The ability to make your web page interactive and interesting. I guess that's in the lessons to come!
3. It was informative to learn about the syntax for how CSS connects with your HTML. I've worked a bit with both HTML and CSS in the past, but never really understood how they influenced each other. I don't know all of the ins and outs yet, but my understanding of the interaction between the two is much better than it used to be.
4. I keep coming back to http://www.w3schools.com/ as a great resource. They've got a lot of examples and explanations of certain HTML and CSS tags, in case I forget quite how something works.
