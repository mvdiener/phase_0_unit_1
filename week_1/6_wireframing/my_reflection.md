## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1. Design and user experience are far more important than I realized. The design can completely make or break a user's experience on the site, and could potentially determine whether the user will come back or not. I can think of sites I enjoy - they are easy to use and streamlined. Other sites I avoid like the plague because they are littered with useless information, and often include popups that cover what I'm trying to read, and force me to deal with them before I can continue using the site.
2. Design is something fairly new to me, so it seemed a bit silly to sketch out what I want a site to look like. My instinct is to just dive into coding instead. But I suppose the design is a good way to have a plan and layout, so you actually know what you're about to code.
3. I found myself asking what are some real examples of wireframes? I found that the Wirify tool listed in one of the lessons was quite helpful in breaking down any site I desired into wireframes.
4. I'm still unsure how I translate my sketch on paper into something coded, but I suppose that will be in the lessons to come.
5. I'm finding some of the reflections a bit tedious. I know it's important to review what you've just learned, but some of the questions seem redundant and I don't always have answers for all of them. Should I spend the time sitting and trying to think of something to say? Or is it more beneficial to continue working through the next lesson? I suppose I'm still trying to manage how all of this works.
