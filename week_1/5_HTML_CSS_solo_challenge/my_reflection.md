## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1. I found myself asking "How do I do that again? What's the right tag for this?" I referred back to the GirlDevelopIt slides frequently, I don't quite have all of the html tags and css committed to memory yet. I also referred back to some of the other challenges I'd completed for reference material.
2. I don't really understand how the pseudo classes for links work yet. The slides aren't entirely clear on how they function, and what I tried to find online didn't help much either. If I had a verbal and visual explanation, I may understand them better.
3. I tried playing around with display:inline-block a bit. I can line up blocks vertically, which is kind of nice, instead of stacking them all horizontally.
4. I'd give myself a 75%, since I had to refer back to syntax a number of times during the challenge. The more I use the info I learned this week, the better I'll feel about the competencies.
5. Being able to try and combine most things I've learned so far was kind of cool. Sort of like learning about each piece of a puzzle, and then putting them all together to make a bigger picture. The bigger picture might be kind of sloppy at first, but it gets better with each pass of the code I wrote.
6. It's a bit tedious trying to view all of my changes. Each time I edit my HTML and CSS files, I need to commit the changes to Git, and then sync them up to GitHub. After that I need to wait until the sync finishes before I can refresh the web page and see if the one bit of code I changed looks any different on the web page. Surely there must be a quicker way to look at the results of my code? I know Stypi has a feature sort of like this, but I haven't found a way to tie a CSS page to an HTML page within Stypi.
