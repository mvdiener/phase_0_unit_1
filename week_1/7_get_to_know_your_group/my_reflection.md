Hey all!
So it looks like the 5 of us are in an accountability group together. I believe we all had the same orientation meeting too, so that's cool! Here's a bit of info about, as per the instructions on this weeks challenge #7.

My name is Max and I live in Portland, OR. After DBC, I plan on coming back to Portland because it's where I grew up, and it's hard not to love this city. I've never been to Chicago before, so this will be a new and fun experience for me.

Here are a few of my favorite websites:
<a href="http://www.twitch.tv" target="_blank">twitch.tv</a> This is a site for video game streams. Being a gamer myself (probably too much gaming), I enjoy watching some of the streams out there.
<a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">Geocaching</a> This is a wonderfully nerdy activity I enjoy, which is essentially treasure hunting done with your GPS. There are millions of caches hidden world wide, so check it out if it sounds interesting to you.
<a href="http://www.thefirstrow.eu/" target="_blank">FirstRowSports</a> This is the site I use to find live streams of almost any sporting event world wide. The quality isn't fantastic, but it beats paying for some crazy cable subscription that I would need to watch all of the hockey I want. Warning: don't visit this site without an AdBlocker on your browser, or you may be visually assaulted by the many ads here. Kind of like that one episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bicyclops_Built_for_Two#Plot" target="_blank">Futurama</a>.

Here is a <a href="http://mvdiener.github.io/" target="_blank">link to my website</a> so far. Once there, you will find a link to my wireframing work, and also some crudely drawn wireframe sketches I did for that challenge. Who knew sketching boxes would be that hard? Heheh...

The last part of this challenge asks us to share our reflections with each other. However, in the reflection itself, it says we first need to review each other's reflections. So... I'm not sure what do do here. I see that in next week's work on challenge 7, we reflect about our fears and concerns with DBC. You guys think we're supposed to skip ahead to that and then come back to this?

Anywho, nice to meet all of you, and I look forward to meeting in person in June.

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Well, I'm not entirely sure how we are supposed to complete this second part. The reflections where we talk about our feelings and fears of DBC doesn't happen until challenge 7 of next weeks work. Should we skip ahead and do that? Or come back to this reflection once that's done? Regardless of how that works, I'm excited to meet all of these awesome people in person this coming June.
